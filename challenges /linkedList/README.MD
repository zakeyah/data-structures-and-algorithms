# Singly Linked List
Linked List is a linear data structure.linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers.

## Challenge
- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node.
- Within your LinkedList class, include a head property.
- Define a method called insert.
- Define a method called includes.
- Define a method called toString.

## Approach & Efficiency
The Big O
space: O(1)
time: O(n)

## API

- Define a method called insert => takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head
- Define a method called includes =>which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result .
- Define a method called toString => returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
- Define a method called Append : which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
- Define a method called insert before : which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the   first value node.
- Define a method called insert after : which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node
- Define a method called kthFromEnd : which takes a number, k, as a parameter. Return the nodeâ€™s value that is k from the end of the linked list
