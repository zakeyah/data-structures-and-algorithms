# Stacks and Queues 

#### A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

#### queue is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence

## Challenge :
#### Create a class for Stack and class for Queue with methods for adding, removing, and viewing a stack and a queue.

## Approach & Efficiency :
## Stack method :
#### 1-Push Big O : space O(1)/time O(1).
#### 2-Pop Big O : space O(1)/time O(1).
#### 3-Peek Big O : space O(1)/time O(1).
#### 4-IsEmpty Big O : space O(1)/time O(1).

## Queues mehtod : 
#### 1-Enqueue Big O : space O(1)/time O(1).
#### 2-Dequeue  Big O : space O(1)/time O(1).
#### 3-Peek Big O : space O(1)/time O(1).
#### 4-IsEmpty  Big O : space O(1)/time O(1).


## API :
### Stack Class : 
##### Push : Add node to the stack .
##### Pop: Remove node from the stack.
##### Peek: Returns the value of the node located on top of the stack
##### IsEmpty : Checks if a stack is empty. Retruns boolean value (true,false).

### Queues Class :

##### Enqueue: Add node to the queue .
##### Dequeue: Removes a node from the queue.
##### Peek: Returns the value of the node located in the front of the queue
##### IsEmpty:Checks if a queue is empty. Returns boolean value(true,false).
