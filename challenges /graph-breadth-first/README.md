# Graphs Breadth First
- Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm that is used to graph data or searching tree or traversing structures. The full form of BFS is the Breadth-first search. The algorithm efficiently visits and marks all the key nodes in a graph in an accurate breadthwise fashion.

## Challenge
- add method for the Graph class
- breadth first
- Arguments: Node
- Return: A collection of nodes in the order they were visited.
- Display the collection

## Approach & Efficiency
- Big O:

- Time O(n) 
- Space O(n)
